    "Project Title: Student Performance Prediction Using Decision Tree Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "Author: Md. Maruf\n",
    "Date: 26-12-2025\n",
    "Version: 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Overview:\n",
    "This project aims to predict the performance of students based on various features such as \n",
    "study hours, attendance, previous grades, and other relevant attributes. The main goal is to \n",
    "classify students into different performance categories (e.g., low, medium, high) using \n",
    "a Decision Tree Classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset:\n",
    "- Source: [mention dataset source, e.g., Kaggle or local CSV file]\n",
    "- Features: study hours, attendance, previous grades, extracurricular activities, etc.\n",
    "- Target: Student performance category (e.g., 'Low', 'Medium', 'High')\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives:\n",
    "1. Load and explore the student performance dataset.\n",
    "2. Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, normalize if needed).\n",
    "3. Train a Decision Tree Classifier model.\n",
    "4. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "5. Visualize the decision tree for better understanding and interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools & Libraries:\n",
    "- Python 3.x\n",
    "- pandas, numpy\n",
    "- scikit-learn\n",
    "- matplotlib, seaborn (for visualization)\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Outcome:\n",
    "- A trained Decision Tree model capable of predicting student performance.\n",
    "- Insights into which features most influence student performance.\n",
    "- Visual representation of the decision-making process of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "- Ensure to split the dataset into training and testing sets to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "- Hyperparameter tuning may be applied to improve model accuracy.\n"
