    "Project Title: Student Performance Prediction Using Decision Tree Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "Author: Md. Maruf\n",
    "Date: 26-12-2025\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Overview:\n",
    "This project aims to predict the performance of students based on various features such as \n",
    "Student_ID,Age,Gender,Class,Study_Hours_Per_Day,Attendance_Percentage,and other relevant attributes. The main goal is to classify students into different performance categories using a Decision Tree Classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset:\n",
    "- Source: Dataset downloaded from kaggle.\n",
    "- Features: Student_ID,Age,Gender,Class,Study_Hours_Per_Day,Attendance_Percentage,       Parental_Education,Internet_Access,Extracurricular_Activities,Math_Score,Science_Score,English_Score,Previous_Year_Score,Final_Percentage,Performance_Level,Pass_Fail.\n",
    "- Target: Student performance category (Pass or Fail)\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives:\n",
    "1. Load and explore the student performance dataset.\n",
    "2. Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, normalize if needed).\n",
    "3. Train a Decision Tree Classifier model.\n",
    "4. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, recall, and F1-score, Classification report, Confussion Metrics, ruc auc score.\n",
    "5. Visualize the decision tree for better understanding and interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools & Libraries:\n",
    "- Python 3.x\n",
    "- pandas, numpy\n",
    "- scikit-learn\n",
    "- matplotlib, seaborn (for visualization)\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Outcome:\n",
    "- A trained Decision Tree model capable of predicting student performance.\n",
    "- Insights into which features most influence student performance.\n",
    "- Visual representation of the decision-making process of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "- Ensure to split the dataset into training and testing sets to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "- Hyperparameter tuning may be applied to improve model accuracy.\n"
